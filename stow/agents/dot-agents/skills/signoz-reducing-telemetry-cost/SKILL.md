  Investigate and reduce SigNoz telemetry ingestion cost and metric
  cardinality across metrics, logs, and traces. Find what drives SigNoz
  spend (via the Cost Meter), which metrics have runaway or unbounded
  label cardinality, and safe, dashboard-, alert-, and Infra-page-aware
  ways to cut volume. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user asks
  "why is my SigNoz bill so high", "what's driving my ingestion cost",
  "reduce telemetry volume", "which metrics cost the most", "cardinality
  health check", or "what can I safely drop", or otherwise asks about
  telemetry spend, ingestion volume, or metric cardinality, even if they
  don't say "cost" or "optimize" explicitly.

## Prerequisites

This skill calls SigNoz MCP server tools heavily (`signoz_list_metrics`,
`signoz_get_field_keys`, `signoz_execute_builder_query`,
`signoz_get_top_metrics`, `signoz_check_metric_usage`, `signoz_check_metric_cardinality`,
`signoz_aggregate_logs`, `signoz_aggregate_traces`, `signoz_search_logs`,
`signoz_list_alert_rules`, `signoz_get_alert`, `signoz_get_service_top_operations`). Before
running the workflow, confirm the `signoz_*` tools are available. If they are not, the SigNoz
MCP server is not installed or configured; run `signoz-mcp-setup` first. The whole
investigation is grounded in these queries; without the server there is nothing to analyze.

Read both reference files before drawing conclusions:
- `references/otel-attribute-cardinality.md`: classify any metric label you encounter.
- `references/infra-do-not-drop.md`: the metrics that power the built-in Infrastructure page
  **and the APM/Services page** (span-derived `signoz_*` RED metrics); never present these as
  "safe to drop" even when usage shows them unused.

## Workflow

Always start with the Cost Meter snapshot (Step 1). For a full cost investigation, run the
metrics, logs, and traces steps for every signal with data, ordered by current cost contribution
(primary, secondary, tertiary). Finish with the report (Step 5).

### Step 1: Cost Meter snapshot

Establish the cross-signal cost picture first. Always call `signoz_list_metrics` with
`source: "meter"`; treat its returned metric names, types, temporalities, and units as the live
source of truth because the meter set evolves. Then query each relevant discovered metric with
`signoz_execute_builder_query` (`source: "meter"`, `requestType: "time_series"`,
`stepInterval: 3600`, the discovered `temporality`, and `timeAggregation: "sum"`); see
`references/cost-meter-queries.md` for the full tool-argument template. Sum complete hourly
buckets and exclude every datapoint marked `partial: true`. Do **not** use
`signoz_query_metrics` for Cost Meter totals or grouped total attribution.
Report only values returned by successful queries. If a query fails or returns no usable values
after the MCP tools are available, show the intended query and say that the total could not be
computed; never invent a total. If the tools are unavailable, follow the prerequisite instead.

For a rolling 7-day window (`end` = now, `start` = end − 7 days), get the per-signal totals
(span size, log size, metric datapoints), then compute and report:

- **Primary cost driver.** The signal with the highest *dollar* weight: traces/logs at
  $0.30/GB, metrics at $0.10/M samples (orientation only; never quote dollar savings). This
  picks by cost, not by raw volume.
- **Bytes per record.** span.size ÷ span.count and log.size ÷ log.count, which tells you whether a
  signal is a payload-size problem or a volume problem.

Then break the primary signal down by environment and service. First call
`signoz_get_field_keys` with `signal: "metrics"` and `source: "meter"`; use only keys it returns
and copy each key's `name`, `fieldDataType`, `fieldContext`, and `signal` into the raw
builder `groupBy` without translating or dropping fields. Run the same meter query with that
complete `groupBy` and report the top
~10 per group with their share. If a non-prod environment (`staging`, `dev`, `test`, `qa`,
`sandbox`, `preview`, `uat`, …) is > 40% of volume, recommend Ingestion Limits on that key
before any signal-level change: https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/

### Step 2: Metrics

Run when the Cost Meter shows metric data, ordered by its cost contribution, or when the user
explicitly asks about metric cost or cardinality.

**2a. Rank by volume with `signoz_get_top_metrics`.** Returns the top 100 metrics by ingested
samples with percentages pre-computed and `totalValue` sample counts (pass `start`/`end`). This
is the volume-ranked worklist. Histogram metrics (`.bucket` suffix) are usually the top
contributors, since each bucket boundary is a separate sample per scrape.

**2b. Check usage with `signoz_check_metric_usage`.** Pass the top metric names (batch of ≤ 50 per
call). Returns `{ dashboards, alerts, error }` per metric. A metric is a drop candidate only when
its `error` is empty **and** both `dashboards` and `alerts` are empty. If `error` is non-empty the
lookup is incomplete (a timeout, or an older SigNoz that lacks the endpoint) and the returned
lists are unreliable, so never treat that metric as unused; mark it **Needs one check first** (verify
its usage manually). A clean lookup with both lists empty is a drop candidate, except for the guard
below.

> **Do-not-drop guard (mandatory).** Before calling any empty-usage metric a "safe drop", check
> it against `references/infra-do-not-drop.md`. The Infrastructure page (Hosts / Kubernetes)
> queries `system.*` and many `k8s.*` / `container.*` metrics through built-in queries, *not*
> dashboards, so usage-check reports them empty even though dropping them breaks that page. If
> a candidate matches the do-not-drop set, present it as **"Infra-page dependency: breaks the
> Hosts/Kubernetes view; confirm you don't use that view before dropping,"** never as "safe to
> drop." This overrides the empty usage result. Also exclude internal `signoz_` / `signoz.`
> metrics (auto-generated RED metrics that power the APM page, not customer-controlled).

**2c. Inspect cardinality with `signoz_check_metric_cardinality`.** Run this for metrics that are
not drop candidates and for any drop candidate the user chooses to retain. Cardinality analysis
adds no value for a metric the user has agreed to drop. The tool returns attribute keys sorted
highest-cardinality first, each with `valueCount` and sample `values`. Classify each with
`references/otel-attribute-cardinality.md`:

- **UNBOUNDED** (`url.full`, `http.target`, `db.query.text`, `client.port`, `trace.id`,
  `exception.stacktrace`, …): grow without ceiling; flag regardless of current count.
- **ACCUMULATING** (`container.id`, `k8s.pod.uid`, `k8s.pod.name`, `k8s.pod.start_time`):
  `valueCount` reflects historical pod churn, not active series; explain the distinction.
- **HIGH but bounded** (`valueCount` ≳ 100): check whether dashboards/alerts actually filter on
  that label before recommending aggregation.

> **Infra identity override (mandatory).** For a metric protected by
> `references/infra-do-not-drop.md`, preserve the identity attributes and page metadata used by
> that metric's Infra entity/view. Do not aggregate or remove entity UID/name attributes when they
> resolve that entity. Keep `k8s.pod.start_time` on Pod metrics because the Pods page uses it for
> Pod Age. This overrides the generic ACCUMULATING fixes in the cardinality reference.

To reduce cardinality use the `metricstransform` processor's `aggregate_labels` action to *merge*
series (samples are the billable cost, so merging is what actually cuts it), not the `transform`
processor's `delete_key`, which leaves the same sample count and creates colliding series. If a
label is essential to the metric's identity, drop the whole metric or fix it at the SDK instead.
For histograms, reducing bucket boundaries cuts samples with little P99 impact. Docs:
https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/drop-metrics/ ·
https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/dropping-metric-labels/

**2d. Review the collection interval.** For a high-volume metric that must be kept, identify how
it is produced and its current interval before recommending a change. A longer interval reduces
ingested datapoints but also lowers time resolution, so preserve the resolution required by its
dashboards and alerts. Use the source's own control: a receiver `collection_interval` for
Collector-generated metrics, the scrape interval for Prometheus-scraped metrics, or
`OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` for SDK push metrics when that SDK supports it. Never recommend
switching a metric between delta and cumulative temporality; changing temporality for the same
metric can break SigNoz queries.

### Step 3: Logs

Run when the Cost Meter shows log data, ordered by its cost contribution, or when the user
explicitly asks about log cost.

**3a. Total + attribution decides the path.**
- Total log GB (the absolute cost figure): use `signoz_execute_builder_query` with the discovered
  meter metric whose live unit and meaning represent log bytes, summed as in Step 1.
- Attribution: run the **same meter query grouped by `service.name`**. This returns one group per
  service plus an unset/empty-`service.name` group for logs with no attribution. Compute the ratio
  entirely from THIS grouped result so numerator and denominator share one basis; a grouped sum can
  differ from the ungrouped total, so never divide the grouped attributed sum by the ungrouped
  total:
  - attributed GB = sum of the groups with a non-empty `service.name`.
  - grouped total = sum of *all* groups (including the empty one).
  - **Attribution % = attributed ÷ grouped total.**
- This is a hard branch:
  - **≥ 10% → Path A (service mode).**
  - **< 10% → Path B (namespace mode).** Logs come from an infra forwarder (Fluent Bit /
    Fluentd / Vector), not OTel SDKs, so `service.name` isn't set. Path B is a less common
    setup, so sanity-check its numbers.

**3b. Analyze the selected attribution path and identify candidate fixes.** The fixes in this
step are candidates only. Complete the alert check in Step 3c before recommending any log-volume
reduction, including a source log-level change.

**Path A, service mode (≥ 10%).** Get the severity mix with `signoz_aggregate_logs`,
`aggregation: count`, `groupBy: "service.name,severity_text"`. Classify severities: REDUCIBLE =
INFO, INFORMATION, DEBUG, TRACE, VERBOSE; HIGH-SIGNAL = ERROR, FATAL, CRITICAL, WARN, WARNING.
For each top service by GB:
- Reducible-dominant + own service code → candidate: set `LOG_LEVEL=WARN` (stops generation at
  source).
- Reducible-dominant + third-party library → candidate: Collector filter on
  `instrumentation_scope.name`
  (read the scope from a `signoz_search_logs` sample's `scope_name`).
- No source access → candidate: Collector filter on `severity_text` matching **only the reducible
  set** (INFO/DEBUG/TRACE), never a range that also catches WARN+.
- High-signal-dominant (WARN/ERROR > 50%) → the logs are worth keeping; a high error rate may be
  a real problem, so flag it separately, do not recommend filtering it away.

> **Service severity guard.** The candidate fixes above (`LOG_LEVEL=WARN`, or a Collector filter
> scoped to INFO/DEBUG only) preserve WARN+ by construction, so the severity mix does not block
> them; Step 3c still determines whether an alert depends on the records. The guard applies only
> to actions that would *also* drop high-signal logs: a **blanket service drop**, or a
> `severity_text` filter whose range includes WARN/ERROR/FATAL/CRITICAL. Before recommending one
> of those, compute high-signal %
> = (all HIGH-SIGNAL severities, including ERROR, FATAL, CRITICAL, WARN, **and WARNING**, matched
> case-insensitively) ÷ service total. **If it is > 1% (or a non-trivial absolute count), do not
> take the blanket action**: keep the reduction scoped to INFO/DEBUG and flag the errors as a real
> signal.

**Path B, namespace mode (< 10%).**
- Top namespaces: `signoz_aggregate_logs`, `count`,
  `groupBy: "k8s.namespace.name,deployment.environment"`, order by count desc, limit ~10. Use a
  **24h** window (7-day namespace scans time out on large tenants; count is the proxy, since the Cost
  Meter has no namespace dimension).
- Severity per namespace: `signoz_aggregate_logs`, `count`,
  `groupBy: "k8s.namespace.name,severity_text"`.
- Samples: `signoz_search_logs`, `filter: "k8s.namespace.name = '<ns>'"`, small limit; read
  `body`, `severity_text`, `scope_name`.

> **Namespace severity guard.** high-signal % = (all HIGH-SIGNAL severities, including ERROR, FATAL,
> CRITICAL, WARN, **and WARNING**, matched case-insensitively) ÷ namespace
> total. **If it is > 1% (or a non-trivial absolute count), do not consider dropping or
> filtering the whole namespace.** Scope the filter to the specific noisy pattern (a log
> category, a `severity_text` match, or a component). Never drop a namespace that carries active
> errors. Only namespaces that are essentially all INFO/DEBUG are wholesale-filter candidates,
> subject to Step 3c.

- Empty `severity_text` on samples → the forwarder ships raw lines unparsed; the fix is a
  json/regex parser in the OTel Collector log pipeline (without it, severity filtering is
  impossible).
- `k8s.event.*` logs are often high-volume / low-value → droppable if not alerted on.

**3c. Log alerts: check before any log-reduction recommendation.** `signoz_list_alert_rules`,
**paginating through every page** (follow `pagination.nextOffset` until `pagination.hasMore` is
false; do not stop at the first page, or an alert on a later page is missed and a filter looks
safe when it isn't). Keep `alertType == "LOGS_BASED_ALERT"`. For each, `signoz_get_alert(id)` and read
`condition.compositeQuery.queries[].spec.filter.expression` + `groupBy` to see which service /
severity / namespace it guards. If a filter would blind an alert, mark it **Will break alert
coverage** and name the alert. Docs: https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/guides/drop-logs/

### Step 4: Traces

Run when the Cost Meter shows span data, ordered by its cost contribution, or when the user
explicitly asks about span cost.

**4a. Global operation-name view, read this first.** `signoz_aggregate_traces`,
`aggregation: count`, `groupBy: "name"`, `orderBy: "count() desc"`, limit 20, **no service
filter**. This surfaces auto-instrumentation noise (health checks, SQL, cache, sidecars) across
all services at once.

**4b. Cost per service + ops per service.** Span GB by service: use
`signoz_execute_builder_query` with the discovered meter metric whose live unit and meaning
represent span bytes, summed as in Step 1 and grouped by the `service.name` field returned by
`signoz_get_field_keys` (copying its `name`, `fieldDataType`, `fieldContext`, and `signal`).
Compute each service's % against the **grouped total (sum of all service groups from this same
query)**, not a top-N sum and not the separately-fetched ungrouped total; keep numerator and
denominator on one grouped basis. For each top-3
service by GB, get its dominant operations with `signoz_get_service_top_operations` (or
`signoz_aggregate_traces` with `service: "<svc>"` + `groupBy: "name"`). The op breakdown is
top-3 for brevity, but the error-rate check (4c) and the APM guard below apply to **every**
service you consider reducing.

**4c. Error rate per service.** `signoz_aggregate_traces`, `count`, `groupBy: "service.name"`
(total), then again with `error: true`. Error rate = errors ÷ total, per service.

**4d. Trace alerts.** `signoz_list_alert_rules`, **paginating through every page** (follow
`pagination.nextOffset` until `pagination.hasMore` is false). Keep
`alertType == "TRACES_BASED_ALERT"`; `signoz_get_alert(id)` for what each guards.

**Classify the dominant operations.**
- Common noise candidates: health/liveness (`/health`, `/ping`, `/ready`,
  `grpc.health.v1.Health/Check`); proxy/sidecar (`envoy.*`, `istio.*`, `linkerd.*`). Treat these as
  candidates, not automatically safe removals; the APM guard below still applies.
- Research before concluding, and do not assume: SQL fragments (the language decides the library:
  Java → JDBC, Python → SQLAlchemy, Node → pg/mysql2/sequelize, .NET → EF/Dapper); cache commands
  (HMGET/GET/SET… → ioredis, redis-py, Jedis, go-redis…); unfamiliar gRPC methods. Search first;
  if still unidentified after searching, say so.

**Fix layer.** For a confirmed noise operation, prefer the deployed SDK or instrumentation
library's documented disable/exclusion control so generation stops at source. Identify the
language and library before naming a setting; Java, Python, Node.js, and .NET use different
controls. If no SDK control exists, use a Collector filter on the operation name.

> **Span → APM guard (mandatory).** Never recommend or configure head, probabilistic, tail, or
> any other trace sampling as a cost-reduction lever. When a user asks for sampling, state both
> effects: the built-in APM/Services metrics cover only retained traces, so absolute request counts
> and rates undercount real traffic; latency trends and error spikes may remain useful, but the APM
> page no longer represents all requests. This limited usefulness does not make sampling an allowed
> lever, and processor placement is not an exception.
>
> Use SDK exclusions and Collector filters for confirmed noise. State that the removed operation
> will disappear from APM before giving a configuration.

### Step 5: Report what you found

Lead with a **TL;DR**: concise, no headers, two parts:
1. **Cost orientation**: which signal is the primary driver, how much, and what generates it
   (name the service, environment, or metric). If several things together dominate, name them
   with individual shares and combined impact.
2. **Prioritized action list**: every actionable finding in priority order, each with its
   status inline: **Safe to implement** / **Needs one check first** (state what) / **Will break
   dashboards** (name them) / **Will break alert coverage** (name the alert) / **Infra-page
   dependency** (breaks the Hosts/K8s view). For metric drops, include the volume % so the
   reader knows the cost impact.

After the TL;DR, add only evidence or context that was not already stated. Rank the actions using
the decision order in Steps 2–4, but state each finding and guardrail once instead of repeating
the action list or the per-signal playbooks.

Keep it conversational: a prioritized triage list, not a formatted report with headers and
tables. Cover every signal with Cost Meter data in that single list; do not ask whether to inspect
a signal the workflow already analyzed.

## Guardrails

- **Never declare a drop or filter "safe" on a partial check.** Paginate
  `signoz_list_alert_rules` fully (through `pagination.hasMore`) before ruling out alert impact,
  and treat a non-empty `error` from `signoz_check_metric_usage` as *unknown* usage (needs a
  manual check), not as "unused." An incomplete lookup is not a green light.
- **Volume comes from discovered Cost Meter metrics and their live units:** bytes for span/log
  volume or samples for metric volume. Never cite span/log record counts as volume.
- **Cost totals and grouped total attribution use `signoz_execute_builder_query`** with raw
  `timeAggregation: sum`, hourly `stepInterval: 3600`, and complete datapoints only, never
  `signoz_query_metrics`.
- Every Cost Meter `builder_query` sent through that raw escape hatch includes
  `limit: 100` and Query Builder v5 `order: [{key:{name:"__result"},
  direction:"desc"}]`. This is wire `order`, not dashboard `orderBy`; preserve
  it in grouped queries. The limit ranks groups over the whole window, so call
  out the possibility that a short-lived group falls outside the top N.
- **Never present an Infra-page or APM metric as safe to drop** (see
  `references/infra-do-not-drop.md`), even when usage-check shows no dashboards or alerts.
- **Logs:** never recommend dropping/filtering a whole service or namespace that carries active
  ERROR/WARN (> 1% high-signal, or a non-trivial absolute count); scope the filter to the noisy
  pattern. Fix order: at source (`LOG_LEVEL=WARN`) → Collector scope filter
  (`instrumentation_scope.name`) → `severity_text` filter.
- **Logs attribution is a hard threshold:** ≥ 10% → Path A; < 10% → Path B. Compute it.
- **Traces:** never recommend or configure head, probabilistic, tail, or any other sampling.
  Sampling limits the built-in APM/Services metrics to retained traces, so absolute request counts
  and rates no longer represent all traffic.
- **UNBOUNDED and IDENTIFIER labels are always worth flagging**: the problem is trajectory, not
  just current count.
- **Never suggest changing retention. Never estimate dollar savings.** Never call a dashboard or
  alert unused/noisy/redundant; report counts only.
- **Anchor claims to query results.** If a signal has no Cost Meter data, say so; do not
  substitute count-based proxies. Don't re-list metrics already shown in the breakdown; metrics
  outside the top ~20 by volume are individually negligible.
