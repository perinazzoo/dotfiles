Used by the agent to classify any attribute encountered during cardinality analysis.
For each attribute: profile, why it matters, and what to do about it.

## Profiles

- **UNBOUNDED**: grows without ceiling. Every new URL, query, ID, or stack trace creates a new series permanently. These are the most dangerous.
- **ACCUMULATING**: grows with infrastructure churn (pod restarts, deploys). Does not reflect concurrent active series; a metric with 20,000 `k8s.pod.uid` values may only have 50 active pods right now.
- **BOUNDED**: fixed or near-fixed set of values. Safe to keep as a label dimension.
- **DEPLOYMENT_DEPENDENT**: cardinality depends on the deployment scale. Fine at 10 services, dangerous at 500.
- **IDENTIFIER**: always a unique ID per request/event. Should never appear as a metric label. Immediate red flag.

## HTTP / Network

| Attribute | Profile | Notes | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----|
| `url.full` | UNBOUNDED | Full URL including query string and path params. Each unique URL = new series. `/user/123` and `/user/456` are different series. | Aggregate with metricstransform or use `http.route` instead |
| `http.url` | UNBOUNDED | Older convention, same problem as `url.full` | Same |
| `http.target` | UNBOUNDED | URL path + query string. Path params make this unbounded | Use `http.route` (templated path) instead |
| `url.path` | UNBOUNDED | Raw path without query, but still unbounded if path contains IDs | Use `http.route` |
| `url.query` | UNBOUNDED | Query string. Completely unbounded | Drop entirely |
| `http.route` | BOUNDED | Templated route e.g. `/user/{id}`. Fixed set per application | Safe to keep |
| `http.method` | BOUNDED | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc. Fixed set | Safe |
| `http.request_method` | BOUNDED | Same as `http.method`, newer convention | Safe |
| `http.status_code` | BOUNDED | 200, 404, 500 etc. Fixed set | Safe |

| `client.port` | UNBOUNDED | Client-side ephemeral port. Always unbounded | Drop (no diagnostic value) |
| `client.address` | DEPLOYMENT_DEPENDENT | Client IP. Bounded in internal service mesh, unbounded for public-facing APIs | Check cardinality |
| `server.address` | DEPLOYMENT_DEPENDENT | Upstream hostname. Usually bounded | Review |
| `server.port` | BOUNDED | Server-side port. Fixed set | Safe |

## How to classify an unknown attribute

If you encounter an attribute not listed above, reason through these questions:

1. **Can the value be user-supplied, request-scoped, or contain IDs?** → Likely UNBOUNDED. Drop.
2. **Does the value change every time a pod restarts or container is replaced?** → ACCUMULATING. Aggregate away.
3. **Is it a timestamp, UUID, hash, or has segments separated by hyphens/underscores of varying length?** → IDENTIFIER or UNBOUNDED. Drop.
4. **Is it chosen from a fixed vocabulary defined at deploy time?** → Probably BOUNDED. Check actual cardinality to confirm.
5. **Does the cardinality roughly equal the number of running instances/nodes/pods?** → DEPLOYMENT_DEPENDENT. Flag if count is high but not an immediate problem.

When uncertain, report the attribute name, its observed cardinality, and the value pattern (e.g. "looks like UUIDs", "looks like IP:port pairs") and let the user verify.

## Fix reference

For Infra-page metric families, the required identity attributes and page metadata in
`infra-do-not-drop.md` override the generic fixes below.

| Problem | Fix | Where |
|---------|-----|-------|
| UNBOUNDED label on existing metric | `metricstransform` processor: aggregate the label away (merges series) | OTel Collector |
| ACCUMULATING label | Same: `metricstransform` aggregate | OTel Collector |
| IDENTIFIER label (span.id, trace.id, user.id) | `metricstransform` `aggregate_labels` to merge series, or stop emitting it as a metric label | OTel Collector / SDK |
| Raw SQL / stack traces as labels | Instrument correctly: use `db.operation` not `db.query.text` | SDK / instrumentation config |
| Client port (net.peer.port, client.port) | `metricstransform` `aggregate_labels` to merge series, or stop emitting it at the SDK | OTel Collector / SDK |
| Too many service instances | `service.instance.id` is expected to be high; only a problem if it contains timestamps/UUIDs that don't reflect real instance count | Check format |

**Important: cardinality reduction means fewer samples, and samples are the billable cost.**
Use the `metricstransform` processor's `aggregate_labels` action to *merge* the
series that share the remaining labels; that is what actually cuts the series and sample count.
Do **not** use the `transform` processor's `delete_key`: removing a label key without merging
leaves the same number of samples and produces colliding series (SigNoz sums them), so cost does
not drop. If a label is essential to the metric's identity, drop the whole metric or stop
emitting the label at the SDK instead.
